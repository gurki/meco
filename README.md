Melodic Commands (MeCo)
====

Wouldn't it be cool if you could whistle or humm a specific melody to unlock your smartphone? Or just sing the first tones of the Lord of the Rings theme and your movies folder opens. In this project, I set out to do exactly that. For now it is written in JavaScript to be easily sharable among friends to test it out and play around.

Progress
===

The pipeline is completely implemented and functioning. However, I revisited the dominant frequency detection, which now is much more stable using the harmonic product spectrum analysis. Will update the sequence recognition accordingly, soon(tm).
